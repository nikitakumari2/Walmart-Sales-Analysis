# Walmart-Sales-Analysis

This project seeks to analyze Walmart sales data with the goals of identifying top-performing branches and products, examining sales trends across different product categories, and understanding customer behavior. The objective is to enhance and optimize sales strategies based on insights derived from the dataset sourced from the [Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting).

"In this recruiting competition, job-seekers are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact."[source](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting)

# Approach Used

1. __Data Wrangling__:
> This initial step involves inspecting the data to detect any NULL or missing values. Data replacement methods was used to address any such instances. It begins by building a database, creating tables, and inserting the data. Given that during table creation, each field was specified as NOT NULL, and the database inherently filters out null values.
2. __Feature Engineering__:
> a. Add a new column named time_of_day to give insight of sales in the Morning, Afternoon and Evening. This will help answer the question on which part of the day most sales are made.
> b. Add a new column named month_name that contains the extracted months of the year on which the given transaction took place (Jan, Feb, Mar). Help determine which month of the year has the most sales and profit.
