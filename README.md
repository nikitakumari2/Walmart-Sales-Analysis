# Walmart-Sales-Analysis

This project seeks to analyze Walmart sales data with the goals of identifying top-performing branches and products, examining sales trends across different product categories, and understanding customer behavior. The objective is to enhance and optimize sales strategies based on insights derived from the dataset sourced from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition.

"In this recruiting competition, job-seekers are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact." source
